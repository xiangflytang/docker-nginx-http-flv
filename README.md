# Docker-nginx-http-flv
Docker image for a HTTP FLV server running on Nginx

* NGINX Version 1.21.1
* [nginx-http-flv-module](https://github.com/winshining/nginx-http-flv-module) Version 1.2.9

## Configurations
This image exposes port 1935 for RTMP Steams and has 1 default channel named "live".

"live" (your stream name) with your stream key is also accessable via HTTP-FLV on port 8080, so you can use [flv.js](https://github.com/Bilibili/flv.js/) to load `http://<your server ip>:8080/flv?app=live&stream=<your stream key>` to watch the stream.

It also exposes 8080 so you can access `http://<your server ip>:8080/stat` to see the streaming statistics.

The configuration file is in /opt/nginx/conf/, more configuration details can be found at [nginx-http-flv-module](https://github.com/winshining/nginx-http-flv-module/blob/master/README.md).

### keep in mind
if you try to build from a server in china,try to replace the github or ubuntu source to chinese mirror host, so it will not have network issue.
